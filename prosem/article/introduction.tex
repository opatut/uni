\section{Introduction}

File systems are a vital component in any computing system, having the task
of storing and organizing data files on block devices, such as hard drives.
File systems (FS) are generally a piece of software, often implemented as
system drivers. There is a variety of different file systems for different
purposes.

Lustre is a parallel file system. As such, it distributes the data across
multiple nodes, usually independent hardware machines, and allows the access
over network. The concept of Lustre is to be a well-scaling solution for
High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters with a high amout of clients.

In this article I will explain the general idea of Lustre, its core
architecture, as well as some performance measurings and recent improvements.
