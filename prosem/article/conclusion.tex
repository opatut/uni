\section{Conclusion}

As a conclusion, the Lustre project is a promising and well-established storage
solution for high performance computing environments. It is actively being
developed by the Open Source Community as well as many interested companies that
provide funding and employ developers.

It is used in many of the TOP-500 HPC clusters, scales exceptionally well in both
size and throughput, only depending on the network architecture to support the
required speeds.

There is still room for improvements in metadata performance though, but these
bottlenecks are actively being tackled, leading to an even better product in the
foreseeable future.
